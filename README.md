# Axxess-Hackathon
## Inspiration
Inspired by the potential of AI in healthcare, we decided to develop a tool to evaluate diabetes using existing data and machine learning algorithms.

## What it does
Our solution is a user-friendly webpage that acts like a questionnaire to assess a person's diabetes risk. It also provides warnings if the user's symptoms are highly related to positive cases in the database.

## How we built it
To build our program, we utilized the logistic regression method, which is a statistical technique commonly used for analyzing datasets. We built the program using React, Node.js, MongoDB, and Python. We calculated statistical indicators from the confusion matrix to ensure the dataset's reliability.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the biggest challenges we faced was finding raw data on health topics suitable for big data and machine learning. Thanks to UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, we were able to obtain open data on diabetes research.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
As a team, we are proud of our accomplishment in applying our knowledge of computer science to solve real-world problems in healthcare. 

## What we learned
The experience has taught us the value of teamwork, and how to build a full-stack program from scratch in a short time.

## What's next for Diabetes Terminator
Adding data submission function to scale up our dataset and renew statistical indicators. By doing so, we aim to improve the accuracy of our program and provide even better evaluations for diabetes.
